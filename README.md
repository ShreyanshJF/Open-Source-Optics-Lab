## How to run the app

Required Software
- Python 3 [Install Link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- pip (Packet Manager) [Install Link](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/)

After installing python3 and pip, you will need to install the dependencies with pip
```
cd [LOCATION OF DOWNLOADED FOLDER]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, while in the same folder, run the `main.py` file with python

**Windows**
```
py main.py
```
**Mac / Linux**
```
python main.py
```

If you have any issues check if you have the python 3.9+ and that you are running it with python3.

On macOS when you install python3 alongside the native version of python on your machine, 
you have to call `python3 main.py` instead of `python main.py`
